## Introduction
The rapid advancement of generative AI has fueled a surge in sophisticated voice phishing scams, where synthetic voice clones impersonate individuals using deepfake technology to deceive victims into financial fraud. Recent studies by researchers from Harvard and Meta reveal that approximately 1 in 6 adults could comply with emotional and relationship-based AI voice-cloning scams, such as a family emergency, which is more persuasive than the typical call center impersonation. Researchers warn that as this technology spreads, scam calls will become fully automated and the cost of mass dialing will plummet, making scalable defense mechanisms urgent.

Our objective is to develop a baseline deepfake voice detector by training and comparing the performance of various models to combat this increasing problem. To accomplish this, we use the [In-the-Wild dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mueller91/In-The-Wild) introduced by Müller et al. (2022), which contains 31,779 real and fake audio recordings from public figures and is released under CC BY-SA 4.0. We will split the dataset into two parts: 70% for training and 30% for validation, processing raw audio files via librosa to extract Mel-spectrogram features, and training image-based and hybrid neural network architectures on a local workstation (WSL2, NVIDIA RTX 3060).

Once trained, the models will be thoroughly evaluated to assess their effectiveness, with potential scope expansions depending on the results. Ultimately, this project explores practical data-driven pipelines to safeguard individuals against automated audio-based security threats.
